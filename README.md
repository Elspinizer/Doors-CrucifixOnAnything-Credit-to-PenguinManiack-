You can edit these variables:

_G.Uses: Amount of times you can use the crucifix before it breaks, I usually put 500000000 because I want it to be infinite.
_G.Range: The range of the crucifix, (reccomended 50)
_G.Fail: Set it to true if you want the crucifix to fail like it does on figure and seek
